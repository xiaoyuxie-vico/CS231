# Linear Classification

- The disadvantages of kNN
    - The classifier must *remember* all of the training data and store it for future comparisons with the test data. This is space inefficient because datasets may easily be gigabytes in size.
    - Classifying a test image is expensive since it requires a comparison to all training images.
- score function, loss function
    - a score function that maps the raw data to class scores,
    - and a loss function that quantifies the agreement between the predicted scores and the ground truth labels.
    - **We will then cast this as an optimization problem in which we will minimize the loss function with respect to the parameters of the score function.**

## Parameterized mapping from images to label scores

- notation `N, D, K`

- Linear classifier

    $f(x_i, W, b) = W x_i + b$

    - An advantage of this approach is that the training data is used to learn the parameters W,b, but once the learning is complete we can discard the entire training set and only keep the learned parameters.
    - Lastly, note that classifying the test image involves a single matrix multiplication and addition, which is significantly faster than comparing a test image to all training images.

> Foreshadowing: Convolutional Neural Networks will map image pixels to scores exactly as shown above, but the mapping ( f ) will be more complex and will contain more parameters.

## Interpreting a linear classifier

- **Analogy of images as high-dimensional points. (Geometric interpretation)**

    As we saw above, every row of $W$ is a classifier for one of the classes. The **geometric interpretation** of these numbers is that as we change one of the rows of $W$, the corresponding line in the pixel space will **rotate in different directions**. The biases $b$, on the other hand, allow our classifiers to **translate the lines**. In particular, note that without the bias terms, plugging in  $x_i=0$  would always give score of zero regardless of the weights, so all lines would be forced to cross the origin.

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%201.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%201.png)

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%202.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%202.png)

- **Interpretation of linear classifiers as template matching**
    - Another interpretation for the weights $W$ is that each row of $W$ corresponds to a **template** (or sometimes also called a **prototype**) for one of the classes. The score of each class for an image is then obtained by **comparing each template with the image using an inner product (or dot product) one by one** **to find the one that “fits” best**. With this terminology, the linear classifier is doing **template matching**, where the templates are learned.
    - Another way to think of it is that **we are still effectively doing Nearest Neighbor, but instead of having thousands of training images we are only using a single image per class** (although we will learn it, and it does not necessarily have to be one of the images in the training set), **and we use the (negative) inner product as the distance instead of the L1 or L2 distance.**

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%203.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%203.png)

    Skipping ahead a bit: Example learned weights at the end of learning for CIFAR-10. Note that, for example, the ship template contains a lot of blue pixels as expected. This template will therefore give a high score once it is matched against images of ships on the ocean with an inner product.

- **Image merge**

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%204.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%204.png)

    - Additionally, note that the horse template seems to contain a **two-headed horse**, which is due to both left and right facing horses in the dataset. **The linear classifier merges these two modes of horses in the data into a single template.**
    - Similarly, the car classifier seems to have merged several modes into a single template which has to identify cars from all sides, and of all colors. In particular, this template ended up being red, which hints that there are more red cars in the CIFAR-10 dataset than of any other color.
    - **The linear classifier is too weak to properly account for different-colored cars**, but as we will see later neural networks will allow us to perform this task.
    - Looking ahead a bit, **a neural network will be able to develop intermediate neurons in its hidden layers that could detect specific car types** (e.g. green car facing left, blue car facing front, etc.), and **neurons on the next layer could combine these into a more accurate car score through a weighted sum of the individual car detectors.**
- Bias trick

    $f(x_i, W, b) = W x_i + b$    →   $f(x_i, W) = W x_i$

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%205.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%205.png)

- Image data preprocessing

    normalization

    In particular, it is important to **center your data** by subtracting the mean from every feature.

    - In the case of images, this corresponds to computing a mean image across the training images and **subtracting** it from every image to get images where the pixels range from approximately [-127 … 127].
    - Further common preprocessing is to **scale** each input feature so that its values range from [-1, 1].

## Loss function

**loss function** (or sometimes also referred to as the **cost function** or the **objective**)

### **Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) loss**

- **Aim:**

    The SVM loss is set up so that the SVM “wants” the correct class for each image to a **have a score higher than the incorrect classes by some fixed margin** $**\Delta$.**

    The SVM “wants” a certain outcome in the sense that the outcome would yield a lower loss (which is good).

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%206.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%206.png)

    **The Multiclass Support Vector Machine "wants" the score of the correct class to be higher than all other scores by at least a margin of delta. If any class has a score inside the red region (or higher), then there will be accumulated loss. Otherwise the loss will be zero. Our objective will be to find the weights that will simultaneously satisfy this constraint for all examples in the training data and give a total loss that is as low as possible.**

- Precise explanation - formula

    The score function takes the pixels and computes the vector $f(x_i,W)$ of class scores, which we will abbreviate to $s$ (short for scores). For example, the score for the j-th class is the j-th element: $s_j=f(x_i,W)_j$. 

    The Multiclass SVM loss for the i-th example is then formalized as follows:

    $$L_i = \sum_{j\neq y_i} \max(0, s_j - s_{y_i} + \Delta)$$

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%207.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%207.png)

    **In summary, the SVM loss function wants the score of the correct class $y_i$ to be larger than the incorrect class scores by at least by $\Delta$ (delta). If this is not the case, we will accumulate loss.**

- For linear score functions $f(x_i; W) = W x_i$

    rewrite

    $L_i = \sum_{j\neq y_i} \max(0, w_j^T x_i - w_{y_i}^T x_i + \Delta)$

    where $w_j$ is the j-th row of $W$ $$ reshaped as a column. However, this will not necessarily be the case once we start to consider more complex forms of the score function $f$.

- **Hinge loss**

    The threshold at zero $max(0,−)$ function is often called the hinge loss.

- Squared hinge loss SVM (or L2-SVM)

    $max(0,-)^2$

    **Aim: penalizes violated margins more strongly (quadratically instead of linearly)**

    **The unsquared version is more standard, but in some datasets the squared hinge loss can work better. This can be determined during cross-validation.**

> The loss function quantifies our unhappiness with predictions on the training set.

- Regularization
    - Problem

        The issue is that this set of $W$ is not necessarily unique: there might be many similar $W$ that correctly classify the examples.

        One easy way to see this is that if some parameters $W$ correctly classify all examples (so loss is zero for each example), then any multiple of these parameters $λW$ where $λ \gt 1$ will also give zero loss because this transformation uniformly stretches all score magnitudes and hence also their absolute differences.

    - Aim

        In other words, we wish to encode some preference for a certain set of weights $W$ over others to **remove this ambiguity.**

    - L2 norm
        - **discourages large weights through an elementwise quadratic penalty over all parameters:**

        $$R(W) = \sum_k\sum_l W_{k,l}^2$$

        - it turns out that including the **L2 penalty leads to the appealing max margin property in SVMs** (See [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes3.pdf) lecture notes for full details if you are interested).
    - **The most appealing property is that penalizing large weights tends to improve generalization, because it means that no input dimension can have a very large influence on the scores all by itself.**
        - For **example**, suppose that we have some input vector  $x=[1,1,1,1]$ and two weight vectors $w_1=[1,0,0,0]$, $w_2=[0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]$.
        - Then $w^T_1x=w^T_2x=1$ so both weight vectors lead to the same dot product, but the L2 penalty of $w_1$ is 1.0 while the L2 penalty of $w_2$ is only 0.25.
        - Therefore, according to the L2 penalty the weight vector **$w_2$ would be preferred since it achieves a lower regularization loss.**
        - Intuitively, this is because the weights in w2 are **smaller and more diffuse**. Since the L2 penalty prefers smaller and more diffuse weight vectors, **the final classifier is encouraged to take into account all input dimensions to small amounts rather than a few input dimensions and very strongly**.
        - As we will see later in the class, this effect can **improve the generalization performance** of the classifiers on test images and **lead to less overfitting**.
    - **Full Multiclass SVM loss becomes:**
        - the **data loss** (which is the average loss Li over all examples)
        - the **regularization loss.**

        $$L =  \underbrace{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_i L_i }_\text{data loss} + \underbrace{ \lambda R(W) }_\text{regularization loss} \\\\$$

        expand its full form

        $$L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \sum_{j\neq y_i} \left[ \max(0, f(x_i; W)_j - f(x_i; W)_{y_i} + \Delta) \right] + \lambda \sum_k\sum_l W_{k,l}^2$$

        Where $N$ is the number of training examples.

        - How to determine $\lambda$?

            There is no simple way of setting this hyperparameter and it is usually determined by cross-validation.

    - Regularization about bias
        - Note that **biases** do not have the same effect since, unlike the weights, they **do not control the strength of influence of an input dimension**.
        - Therefore, it is common to only regularize the weights W but not the biases b.
        - **However, in practice this often turns out to have a negligible effect**.
        - **Lastly, note that due to the regularization penalty we can never achieve loss of exactly 0.0 on all examples, because this would only be possible in the pathological setting of W=0.**

- Summary
    - The takeaway from this section is that the **SVM loss** takes one particular approach to **measuring how consistent the predictions on training data are with the ground truth labels.**
    - Additionally, making good predictions on the training set is equivalent to minimizing the loss.

> All we have to do now is to come up with a way to find the weights that minimize the loss.

### Practical Considerations

- **Setting Delta:** What value should it be set to, and do we have to cross-validate it?
    - **It turns out that this hyperparameter can safely be set to** $\Delta = 1.0$ **in all cases.**
    - The hyperparameters $\Delta$ and $\lambda$ seem like two different hyperparameters, but in fact **they both control the same tradeoff**: The tradeoff between the **data loss** and the **regularization loss** in the objective.
    - **The key to understanding this** is that **the magnitude of the weights $W$ has direct effect on the scores** (and hence also their differences): As we shrink all values inside W the score differences will become lower, and as we scale up the weights the score differences will all become higher.
    - Therefore, the exact value of the margin between the scores (e.g.  $\Delta=1$, or   $\Delta=100$) is in some sense meaningless because the weights can shrink or stretch the differences arbitrarily.
    - **Hence, the only real tradeoff is how large we allow the weights to grow (through the regularization strength $\lambda$).**

- Relation to Binary Support Vector Machine

    Binary Support Vector Machines

    $$L_i = C \max(0, 1 - y_i w^Tx_i) + R(W)$$

    where $C$ is a hyperparameter, and $y_i∈(−1,1)$.

    if we only had two classes then the loss reduces to the binary SVM shown above.

- Aside: Optimization in primal

    In this class (as is the case with Neural Networks in general) we will always work with the optimization objectives in their unconstrained primal form.

    Many of these objectives are technically not differentiable (e.g. the max(x,y) function isn’t because it has a kink when x=y), but in practice this is not a problem and it is common to use a subgradient.

- Aside: Other Multiclass SVM formulations.
    - **One-Vs-All (OVA) SVM**: trains an independent binary SVM for each class vs. all other classes.
    - **Structured SVM**: maximizes the margin between the score of the correct class and the score of the highest-scoring incorrect runner-up class
    - **Suggestion in practical**: The version presented in these notes is a safe bet to use in practice, but **the arguably simplest OVA strategy is likely to work just as well.** [Rikin et al. 2004 in In Defense of One-Vs-All Classification (pdf)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/rifkin04a/rifkin04a.pdf)

### Softmax classifier

- Relationship with binary Logistic Regression classifier

    If you’ve heard of the binary Logistic Regression classifier before, the Softmax classifier is its generalization to multiple classes.

- **Overview**
    - Unlike the **SVM** which treats the outputs $f(x_i,W)$ as (uncalibrated and possibly difficult to interpret) **scores for each class**, the **Softmax classifier** gives a slightly more intuitive output (**normalized class probabilities**) and also has a **probabilistic interpretation** that we will describe shortly.
    - In the Softmax classifier, the function mapping $f(x_i;W)=Wx_i$  stays unchanged, but we now interpret these scores as the **unnormalized log probabilities for each class** and replace the hinge loss with a cross-entropy loss that has the form:

        $$L_i = -\log\left(\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{ \sum_j e^{f_j} }\right) \hspace{0.2in} \text{or equivalently} \hspace{0.2in} L_i = -f_{y_i} + \log\sum_j e^{f_j}$$

        where we are using the notation $f_j$ to mean the j-th element of the vector of class scores $f$.

        **Softmax function**: $f_j(z) = \frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_k e^{z_k}}$

- **Information theory view**

    The **cross-entropy** between a “true” distribution $p$ and an estimated distribution $q$ is defined as:

    $$H(p,q) = - \sum_x p(x) \log q(x)$$

    - The Softmax classifier is hence **minimizing the cross-entropy between the estimated class probabilities** ( $q = e^{f_{y_i}} / \sum_j e^{f_j}$as seen above) **and the “true” distribution**, which in this interpretation is the distribution where all probability mass is on the correct class (i.e. $p=[0,…1,…,0]$ contains a single 1 at the yi -th position.).
    - Moreover, since the cross-entropy can be written in terms of entropy and the **Kullback-Leibler divergence** as $H(p,q) = H(p) + D_{KL}(p||q)$, and the entropy of the delta function $p$ is zero, **this is also equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence between the two distributions** (a measure of distance). In other words, the cross-entropy objective wants the predicted distribution to have all of its mass on the correct answer.
- **Probabilistic interpretation**

    $$P(y_i \mid x_i; W) = \frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{f_j} }$$

    can be interpreted as **the (normalized) probability** assigned to the correct label $y_i$ given the image $x_i$ and parameterized by $W$.

    - In the probabilistic interpretation, we are therefore **minimizing the negative log likelihood of the correct class**, which can be interpreted as performing **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).**
    - A nice feature of this view is that we can now also interpret the regularization term $R(W)$ in the full loss function as coming from a Gaussian prior over the weight matrix $W$, where instead of MLE we are performing the **Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation**.
    - We mention these interpretations to help your intuitions, but the full details of this derivation are beyond the scope of this class.

- Practical issues: Numeric stability

    normalization trick

    Notice that if we multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by a constant $C$ and push it into the sum, we get the following (mathematically equivalent) expression:

    $$\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{f_j}}
    = \frac{Ce^{f_{y_i}}}{C\sum_j e^{f_j}}
    = \frac{e^{f_{y_i} + \log C}}{\sum_j e^{f_j + \log C}}$$

    We are free to choose the value of $C$.

    A common choice for C is to set  $\log C = -\max_j f_j$. This simply states that we should shift the values inside the vector f so that the highest value is zero.

    - implementation

        ```python
        f = np.array([123, 456, 789]) # example with 3 classes and each having large scores
        p = np.exp(f) / np.sum(np.exp(f)) # Bad: Numeric problem, potential blowup

        # instead: first shift the values of f so that the highest number is 0:
        f -= np.max(f) # f becomes [-666, -333, 0]
        p = np.exp(f) / np.sum(np.exp(f)) # safe to do, gives the correct answer
        ```

- Possibly confusing naming conventions.
    - To be precise, the **SVM classifier** uses the **hinge loss**, or also sometimes called the **max-margin loss.**
    - The **Softmax classifier** uses the **cross-entropy loss**.
        - The Softmax classifier gets its name from the softmax function, which is used to squash the raw class scores into normalized positive values that sum to one, so that the cross-entropy loss can be applied.
        - In particular, note that technically it doesn’t make sense to talk about the “softmax loss”, since softmax is just the squashing function, but it is a relatively commonly used shorthand.

### SVM vs. Softmax

- Comparison

    ![Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%208.png](Linear%20classification%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Softm%2097d8a5bae5584d6cb304604bf9f79613/Untitled%208.png)

    - The difference is in the interpretation of the scores in **f**:
        - The SVM **interprets these as class scores** and its loss function **encourages the correct class** (class 2, in blue) **to have a score higher by a margin than the other class scores.**
        - The Softmax classifier instead **interprets the scores as (unnormalized) log probabilities for each class** and **then encourages the (normalized) log probability of the correct class to be high** (equivalently the negative of it to be low).
    - The final loss for this example is 1.58 for the SVM and 1.04 (note this is 1.04 using the **natural logarithm**, not base 2 or base 10) for the Softmax classifier,
    - **but note that these numbers are not comparable**; They are only meaningful in relation to loss computed within the same classifier and with the same data.
- **Softmax classifier provides “probabilities” for each class**
    - The reason we put the word “probabilities” in quotes, however, is that **how peaky or diffuse these probabilities are depends directly on the regularization strength $\lambda$** - which you are in charge of as input to the system.
        - Example:
            - $[1, -2, 0] \rightarrow [e^1, e^{-2}, e^0] = [2.71, 0.14, 1] \rightarrow [0.7, 0.04, 0.26]$
            - $[0.5, -1, 0] \rightarrow [e^{0.5}, e^{-1}, e^0] = [1.65, 0.37, 1] \rightarrow [0.55, 0.12, 0.33]$
    - Moreover, in the limit where the weights go towards tiny numbers due to **very strong regularization strength $\lambda$, the output probabilities would be near uniform.** Hence, the probabilities computed by the Softmax classifier are better thought of as **confidences** where, similar to the SVM, the ordering of the scores is interpretable, but the absolute numbers (or their differences) technically are not.

- In practice, SVM and Softmax are usually comparable
    - The performance difference between the SVM and Softmax are usually very small, and different people will have different opinions on which classifier works better.
    - Compared to the Softmax classifier, the **SVM is a more local objective**, which could be thought of either as a bug or a feature. Only care about the margin. The SVM is happy once the margins are satisfied and it does not micromanage the exact scores beyond this constraint. Focusing on the difficult data.
    - **Softmax classifier**: the Softmax classifier is never fully happy with the scores it produces: **the correct class could always have a higher probability and the incorrect classes always a lower probability and the loss would always get better.**
