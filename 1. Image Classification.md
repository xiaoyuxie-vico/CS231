# Image Classification

- Challenges
    - **Viewpoint variation**. A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.
    - **Scale variation**. Visual classes often exhibit variation in their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image).
    - **Deformation**. Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extreme ways.
    - **Occlusion**. The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.
    - **Illumination conditions**. The effects of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.
    - **Background clutter**. The objects of interest may *blend* into their environment, making them hard to identify.
    - **Intra-class variation**. The classes of interest can often be relatively broad, such as *chair*. There are many different types of these objects, each with their own appearance.

- What is a good image classification model?

    **A good image classification model must be invariant to the cross product of all these variations, while simultaneously retaining sensitivity to the inter-class variations.**

## Nearest Neighbor Classifier

- CIFAR-10 dataset

    60,000 tiny images that are 32 pixels high and wide

    a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images

- L1 distance

    $d_1 (I_1, I_2) = \sum_{p} \left| I^p_1 - I^p_2 \right|$

- `np.mean(Yte_predict == Yte)`
- implement **NearestNeighbor**

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    class NearestNeighbor(object):
      def __init__(self):
        pass

      def train(self, X, y):
        """ X is N x D where each row is an example. Y is 1-dimension of size N """
        # the nearest neighbor classifier simply remembers all the training data
        self.Xtr = X
        self.ytr = y

      def predict(self, X):
        """ X is N x D where each row is an example we wish to predict label for """
        num_test = X.shape[0]
        # lets make sure that the output type matches the input type
        Ypred = np.zeros(num_test, dtype = self.ytr.dtype)

        # loop over all test rows
        for i in range(num_test):
          # find the nearest training image to the i'th test image
          # using the L1 distance (sum of absolute value differences)
          distances = np.sum(np.abs(self.Xtr - X[i,:]), axis = 1)
          min_index = np.argmin(distances) # get the index with smallest distance
          Ypred[i] = self.ytr[min_index] # predict the label of the nearest example

        return Ypred
    ```

- L2 distance

    $d_2 (I_1, I_2) = \sqrt{\sum_{p} \left( I^p_1 - I^p_2 \right)^2}$

    ```python
    distances = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(self.Xtr - X[i,:]), axis = 1))
    ```

- L1 vs. L2.

    In particular, the L2 distance is much more unforgiving than the L1 distance when it comes to differences between two vectors. That is, the L2 distance prefers many medium disagreements to one big one.

## k - Nearest Neighbor Classifier

- overfitting

    The very real danger is that you may tune your hyperparameters to work well on the test set, but if you were to deploy your model you could see a significantly reduced performance. In practice, we would say that you overfit to the test set.

    Another way of looking at it is that if you tune your hyperparameters on the test set, you are effectively using the test set as the training set, and therefore the performance you achieve on it will be too optimistic with respect to what you might actually observe when you deploy your model.

> **Evaluate on the test set only a single time, at the very end.**

> **Split your training set into training set and a validation set. Use validation set to tune all hyperparameters. At the end run a single time on the test set and report performance.**

- Cross-validation

    ```python
    # assume we have Xtr_rows, Ytr, Xte_rows, Yte as before
    # recall Xtr_rows is 50,000 x 3072 matrix
    Xval_rows = Xtr_rows[:1000, :] # take first 1000 for validation
    Yval = Ytr[:1000]
    Xtr_rows = Xtr_rows[1000:, :] # keep last 49,000 for train
    Ytr = Ytr[1000:]

    # find hyperparameters that work best on the validation set
    validation_accuracies = []
    for k in [1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]:

      # use a particular value of k and evaluation on validation data
      nn = NearestNeighbor()
      nn.train(Xtr_rows, Ytr)
      # here we assume a modified NearestNeighbor class that can take a k as input
      Yval_predict = nn.predict(Xval_rows, k = k)
      acc = np.mean(Yval_predict == Yval)
      print 'accuracy: %f' % (acc,)

      # keep track of what works on the validation set
      validation_accuracies.append((k, acc))
    ```

- **5-fold cross-validation**

    For example, in 5-fold cross-validation, we would split the training data into 5 equal folds, use 4 of them for training, and 1 for validation. We would then iterate over which fold is the validation fold, evaluate the performance, and **finally average the performance across the different folds.**

    ![Image%20Classification%20Data%20driven%20Approach%20k%20Neares%20f06c084efbdc4339a4e39ccbcba69c97/Untitled%201.png](Image%20Classification%20Data%20driven%20Approach%20k%20Neares%20f06c084efbdc4339a4e39ccbcba69c97/Untitled%201.png)

    Example of a 5-fold cross-validation run for the parameter k. For each value of k we train on 4 folds and evaluate on the 5th. Hence, for each k we receive 5 accuracies on the validation fold (accuracy is the y-axis, each result is a point). The trend line is drawn through the average of the results for each k and the error bars indicate the standard deviation. Note that in this particular case, the cross-validation suggests that a value of about k = 7 works best on this particular dataset (corresponding to the peak in the plot). If we used more than 5 folds, we might expect to see a smoother (i.e. less noisy) curve.

- Pros and Cons of Nearest Neighbor classifier.

    **Pros:**

    - very simple to implement and understand.
    - takes no time to train, since all that is required is to store and possibly index the training data
    - may sometimes be a good choice in some settings (especially if the data is low-dimensional),

    **Cons:**

    - pay that computational cost at test time, since classifying a test example requires a comparison to every single training example.
    - Pixel-based distances on high-dimensional data (and images especially) can be very unintuitive.

    ![Image%20Classification%20Data%20driven%20Approach%20k%20Neares%20f06c084efbdc4339a4e39ccbcba69c97/Untitled%202.png](Image%20Classification%20Data%20driven%20Approach%20k%20Neares%20f06c084efbdc4339a4e39ccbcba69c97/Untitled%202.png)

- Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)

    As an aside, the computational complexity of the Nearest Neighbor classifier is an active area of research, and several Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms and libraries exist that can accelerate the nearest neighbor lookup in a dataset (e.g. FLANN). These algorithms allow one to trade off the correctness of the nearest neighbor retrieval with its space/time complexity during retrieval, and usually rely on a pre-processing/indexing stage that involves building a kdtree, or running the k-means algorithm.

- t-SNE

    their (local) pairwise distances are best preserved.

# Summary

- **Applying kNN in practice**
    - Preprocess your data:

        **Normalize** the features in your data (e.g. one pixel in images) to have **zero mean and unit variance.** 

        We will cover this in more detail in later sections, and chose not to cover data normalization in this section because **pixels in images are usually homogeneous and do not exhibit widely different distributions**, alleviating the need for data normalization.

    - for high-dimensional data

        If your data is very high-dimensional, consider using a **dimensionality reduction technique** such as PCA ([wiki ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [CS229ref](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes10.pdf), [blog ref](https://web.archive.org/web/20150503165118/http://www.bigdataexaminer.com:80/understanding-dimensionality-reduction-principal-component-analysis-and-singular-value-decomposition/)), NCA ([wiki ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_components_analysis), [blog ref](https://kevinzakka.github.io/2020/02/10/nca/)), or even [Random Projections](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/random_projection.html).

    - Split your training data randomly into train/val splits
        1. Split your training data randomly into train/val splits. As a rule of thumb, between **70-90%** of your data usually goes to the **train split**. 
        2. This setting **depends on** how many hyperparameters you have and how much of an influence you expect them to have. 
        3. If there are many hyperparameters to estimate, you should err on the side of having larger validation set to estimate them effectively. 
        4. If you are concerned about the size of your validation data, it is best to **split the training data into folds and perform cross-validation.** 
        5. If you can afford the computational budget it is always safer to go with cross-validation (the more folds the better, but more expensive).
    - Training and evaluation
        1. Train and evaluate the kNN classifier on the validation data (for all folds, if doing cross-validation) for many choices of **k** (e.g. the more the better) and across different distance types (L1 and L2 are good candidates)
    - Time reduction
        1. If your kNN classifier is running too long, consider using an **Approximate Nearest Neighbor library** (e.g. [FLANN](https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann)) to **accelerate the retrieval** (at cost of some accuracy).
    - Take note of the hyperparameters that gave the best results.

        There is a question of whether you should use the full training set with the best hyperparameters, since the optimal hyperparameters might change if you were to fold the validation data into your training set (since the size of the data would be larger). In practice it is cleaner to not use the validation data in the final classifier and consider it to be *burned* on estimating the hyperparameters. Evaluate the best model on the test set. Report the test set accuracy and declare the result to be the performance of the kNN classifier on your data.
